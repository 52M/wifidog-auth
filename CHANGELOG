	* Allow disabling EventLogging class in config.php, to make SQL debuging possible (The class was traping errors before AbstractDb could output them)
	* Make EVENT_LOGGING default to false for now, as it turns out EventLogging was the cause of the 
	Spurious PEAR output ("Runtime Notice: ") we've been seeing.  That is probably only because we don't 
	understand how to properly control it's logging level.

	Should also be a little faster.

2006-04-24 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Revert Rob's SYSTEM_PATH change.  Sorry about that.  The devs spent hours to finally get the PATH
	 stuff consistent and fixing the countless bugs that this process introduced.
	 Maybe some links still need to use BASE_URL_PATH instead of BASE_SSL_PATH,
	(or vice-versa) but it was on purpose that SYSTEM_PATH was not made available to Smarty.
	We already have 3 defines to be used for links and html refs, that's enough
	 BASE_SSL_PATH should be used to enter SSL mode (if available)
 	 BASE_NON_SSL_PATH should be used to break out of SSL mode of when we
 	 explicitely do not want someting to be referenced over http
 	 BASE_URL_PATH should be used in all other cases to avoid needless SSL warning

2006-04-17 Rob Janes <janes.rob@gmail.com>

	* init_php.php: Fix stripslashes_cb() so it actually works, this means the aust server should work properly with auth servers with magic quotes turned on.
	This is still not recommended however.
	* Remove some spurious error ouptut on logout.
	* Remove potential error in network id parsing

2006-03-22 François Proulx <francois.proulx@gmail.com>
	* Fixed Google Maps URLs bug

	  the code path to the map does not use SSL, but the outgoing URLs do.
	* Removed lost echo in Locale.php

2006-03-21 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* login/index.php: Remove huge security hole introduced by stylistic changes in the file.
	A user could login to any hotspot by simply filling a blank form because of a gratuitous
	change from empty to is_null everywhere.  Remove escaping or REQUEST parameters in non SQL
	 related code, as this would lead to double unescaping down the line.  Remove logic dependent
	  on encapsulated side effects of object method call.

	  the page if a user clicks on such a link)
	* refactored hotspot status page, it now uses node list classes to generate
	  output
	* WIFI411_CSV has been removed from hotspot status page - it didn't work

	  content after saving it. If JavaScript is enabled in your browser you
	  can go straight ahead, uncheck the checkbox and delete the content.

	* the "Show all available contents for this hotspot" link won't be shown
	  anymore unless all requirements are meet that all content of a hotspot
	  would be shown. The requirements are: you need to have at least one
	  Content Group tagged artistic and locative content, with at least one
	  content group element available for display.
	  This fixes ticket #35.
	* adjusting the location of a node via the Google maps geocoding service)
	  and clicking the button "Use these coordinates" didn't work
	  This fixes ticket #81 and #82.
	* the content select box now only shows the content to a user of which is
	  is the owner from (same mechanism has already been used on the content
	  manager page) or all content if the user is a superadmin
	* wifidog/admin/content_admin.php removed, because the content manager now
	  uses the generic object administration interface
	* the creation date of a network can be changed now (this value wasn't
	  displayed in the admin interface, even though it was present in the
	  database)
	* revamped administration sidebar, cleaner interface for the superadmin,
	  for the owner of a node nothing changes
	* added "server administration" section to the administration interface
	* Added administration of webservers. For one webserver not much changes.

	  from config.php). Running WiFiDog on two or more webserver (with one
	  database) you now can define the different hostnames of the webserver.
	  Of course you can also define, which of those webserver serves SSL. This
	  is for example essential for the Google maps feature (different API keys
	  for different hostnames)
	* for every network you now can define it's own Google Map initial values
	  and map types
	* Hotspots map page now supports different maps for different networks

	  first use

	  being logged in you'll be redirected to the administration interface after
	  a successful login, if you are an admin or owner of a node. This only
	  works for a virtual login, as it isn't needed to be done when logging in
	  via a WiFiDog node (then you have to login anyway on the splash page
	  first)
	* fixed preview of network in administration interface as content for a
	  network as is isn't available in the code, yet

2006-02-13 Rob Janes <janes.rob@gmail.com>
    * cron/cleanup.php needed new way to call common.php
	* added cron/vacuum.php to round things out

2006-02-07 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Fix a bunch of file inclusion bugs in the statistics subsystem.
	  This is only a ad-hac fix. It seems the requires for just about every
	  class have been stripped off. This must be fixed, all classes should
	  require_once all classes or include that they need that isn't included by
	  a parent class.

2006-02-06 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	* caching class now supports lifetime of a cache and every data type
	  supported by PHP (except the resource-type)
	* Content class caches available content plugins for 7 days if caching has
	  been enabled -> results in a nice speed-up on every page call because
	  of 17 saved filesystem queries
	* converted Security class to PHP5 style and it's functions to static
	  functions
	* fixed broken HTMLeditor support
	* implemented PEAR::HTML_Safe cache support - if PEAR::HTML_Safe has been
	  installed it strips down all potentially dangerous content within HTML
	  that has been entered using the content plugins Langstring,
	  TrivialLangstring and HTMLeditor
	* moved /wifidog/include/HTMLeditor to /wifidog/content/HTMLeditor
	* fixed thrown exception in path_defines_base.php (sprintf() was used
	  uncorrectly)
	* template for definition of SYSTEM_PATH has been added to config.php
	  for easier definiton when path detection failes
	* from now on caching is enabled by default in config.php - it means that
	  WiFiDog caching features will automaticly be used if PEAR::Cache_Lite
	  has been installed
	* updated installation file to represent all the new modules that can be
	  installed to use all WiFiDog features

2006-01-31 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	  more meaningfull output

2006-01-29 Max Horváth <max.horvath@maxspot.de>
	* WiFiDog now detects APC PHP cache and eAccelerator PHP cache and disables
	  both PHP caches, because WiFiDog currently doesn't run with either of
	  those PHP caches (I'm still investigating why)
	* added a missing <ul> HTML tag on the administration page
	* the validation mail sent to new users now includes the full path to the
	  WiFiDog installation (before it assumed WiFiDog to be installed in
	  the document root of the webserver)

	  in the document root of the webserver

	* fixed error messages not displaying technical support e-mail address

2006-01-25 Max Horváth <max.horvath@maxspot.de>
	* a notice message regarding timezones was being displayed when running PHP
	  5.1.0+ due to rewritten date functions of PHP. There is a new config flag
	  in config.php named DATE_TIMEZONE. Set it to your local timezone.
	  Don't forget to update your local.config.php in case you're using it.

2006-01-24 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Dependencies.php:  We missed one more instance of non-unifrom code for
	  path detection. The Dependencies class now uses the code in
	  include/path_defines_base.php like the rest of the system. Also make it
	  returns more usefull error messages.
	* SmartyWifidog.php: Output the error returned by Dependencies if Smarty
      cannot be found for some reason.

2006-01-23 Max Horváth <max.horvath@maxspot.de>

	  wifidog.org
	* renamed "ChangeLog" to CHANGELOG, resulting this file being parsed by
	  PHPdoc
	* moved "header.gif" image to its own folder in the images directory
	* touched almost every PHP file in WiFiDog auth server for PHPdoc generating
	  compiling without any warnings
	* Initialized uninitialized variables in Node class
	* Fixed initialization error of one variable
	* Configuration file (config.php) will be read before path detection is
	  being started (otherwise there was no chance to set a manual SYSTEM_PATH)

2006-01-08 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
 	* common.php: Improve path detection code, and start moving PATH detection

 	  variables for path related stuff, all you need is already available
 	  in defines.
 	* UserReport.php: Remove dangling reference to BASEPATH.
 	* install.php: Use centralised path detection.

2006-01-04 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* config.php, common.php: Completely remove SYSTEM_PATH from config.php,
	  making one less config option to manage.  It is now autodetected.

	* added support for classes/EventLogging.php.
	* modified include/common.php to pull in the EventLogging class
	* modified index.php to kick start error logging with minimal setup.
	  I didn't setup a css for this, so any errors are simply pushed out
	  when the logging channel is destructed.
	* other changes to include/common.php - a host of utility functions,
	  prefixed with "cmn" to avoid namespace collision.
	* stock config.php, added global $AVAIL_LOCALE_ARRAY, cause of my change
	  to include/common.php, wrapping the require_once in a function.

2006-01-04 Pascal Leclerc <isf@plec.ca>

      creation

2006-01-02 Rob Janes <janes.rob@gmail.com>

	  local_content/common/stylesheet.css has all the rest.
	* classes/MainUI.php changed to <link ...> the common stylesheet.css, while
	  still smarty fetching the templated stylesheet.
	* classes/SmartyWifidog.php changed to set a smarty template variable so
	  that the templating stylesheet could work.

	  a server, you can add your users, and then change the authenticator class
	  from AuthenticatorLocalUser to AuthenticatorLocalUserNoSignup

	  is still shown for signing up.

	  and to transition to using MAC address as node ID.
	* Fix a saving problem with all the content types with some versions of PHP
	* Add a new Content type:  IFrameRest.  This allows the result of a REST
	  style query returning HTML to be displayed in a HTML iframeset. Currently
	  supported are substitution of the node_id, the user_id and the last
	  display date in the get query.
	* CVS version of the auth server should now be "reasonnably" safe to use in
	  production, so the 2005-09-01 notice is no longuer in effect.

	* Statistics:  At long last, the monster statistics commit.
	  We finally have a stable, documented and uniform codebase for statistics.
	  This resulted is removal of several functions in other classes too.
	  There are a few new reports, but mostly, each report is a lot more
	  flexible.
	  Still TODO:
	  - Security:  This is to be implemented directly in the Statistics class,
	    by forcing restrictions to the selected nodes and network.
	  - Support selecting multiple users for a report.
	    The code and SQL queries support it, but the UI doesn't. An easy and
	    quick way would be to simply parse a coma-separated list. Comment are
	    off course welcome!

2005-09-25 Francois Proulx <francois.proulx@gmail.com>
	* Updated initial SQL script to schema 29

	* schema_validate.php:  Fix a bug version 26.  The conversion of the old

	  manually if you already ran the script, you must quote the parameter in
	  column network_authenticator_params in the networks table.
	* Network.php:  Fix improper quoting of Authenticator arguments.
	* RssPressReview.php:  Make expansion of today's item optionnal.

	* portal/inted.php:  Implement the start button functionnality (maybe it
	  would be better to call it "use the Internet").  From now on, once
	  authenticated and when pressing the start button on the portal, the user
	  will be sent to the page he originally tried to access.  A second window
	  will be popped with the portal page so he can come back to it. The window
	  is collapsed, and can be expanded back by clicking on the link. I tried
	  to make it cross platform (and mostly did) but it's still buggy in IE.

	  At the same time, this fixes the goof reported by Rob Kelley of
	  nycwireless.net

	  start button but for some reason the original url is unavailable

	  isn't installed) inside the static setCurrentLocale method, completely

	  untested fix.

	  message

2005-02-14 Philippe April <philippe@ilesansfil.org>
	* wifidog/locale/gen.s: Was not working as expected, it will now get the

	  compensate for disparate publication intervals.  An entry from a feed that
	  does not publish often will live longer than an entry from a feed that
	  publishes very often.  If a feed doesn't have any entry that makes the
	  cut, it will not appear at all.

	  page was actually served over SSL, all media in the file will be served
	  over SSL. Add a new define (BASE_NON_SSL_PATH) to allow us to make links
	  that break out of SSL mode.  From now on, use the self adapting
	  BASE_URL_PATH in most circumstance, BASE_SSL_PATH to enter SSL mode,
	  and BASE_URL_PATH to break out of it.

	  Cosmetic fixes
 	* wifidog/local_content/default/login.html.fr, portal.html.fr: Delete the

	  script to the chances will be available in the cvs schemas and initial
	  data.
	* sql/dump_initial_data_postgres.sh: This does the actual dump of the data
	  in a runnable form.  Note that this needs to be edited manually if you add

	  run wifidog in debug level 7 to see it. That message should be parsed so
	  it is visible in debug level 6.
	* wifidog/auth/index.php:   Fix code injection vulnerability.

2004-08-27 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>

	  To be used by wifidog to do heartbeats.

2004-08-07 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Add code to import a NoCat user database (passwd).  The username will be
	  generated from the first part of the email if the name was en email.
	* Change password hashing algorithm to make it compatible with NoCat (For
	  the curious among you, the hashing algorithm is now:  take the md5
	  digest in binary format of the password, and base64 encode it.
	* Table schema changed to accomodate newhash length (users.pass is now
	  varchar(32))
	* The user is now allowed to login with either his username or his email.

2004-08-03 Pascal Leclerc  <pascal@plec.ca>

	  to true if gettext is available.  If false, blank _() and gettext()
	  functions will be defined so the system still works.

2004-08-03 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* Fix BASE_URL_PATH to properly detect non-standard server ports (hopefully).

2004-08-02 Benoit Grégoire  <bock@step.polymtl.ca>
	* wifidog-auth lives! New since the dark ages
	* Demo page to allow people to hack more easely on it
	* Support for multiple nodes.  TODO:  Merge with the database project.
	* Very cool local content architecture.  Every hotspot can have a folder in
	  the local_content directory.  This folder can be filed by a single logo,
	  leaving all the rest to the default content, or be completely custom
	  (stylesheet, login page, portal page, header, etc.)
	* Everything in local content is templated with smarty, no problem with
	  web designer wrecking havoc on the auth server.  You can edit everything
	  in local_content/default even if you only speak html.
	* No need to set any path in the web server config files (that one was a
	  bitch to implement)
	* RSS feed support (optionnal, with magpierss), one feed per node (url
	  stored in the database, works great, but no gui to edit it yet) and one
	  network-wide RSS feed.
	* All path are editable from the config file
	* "Productize" the thing, so it make sense for other groups to install it
	  (the network name, url, default RSS, and such are set from the config
	  file).
	* Put most strings in gettext calls for easy future translation.
	* User can request that the server send the validation email again
	* User can change password
	* User who forgot his username can have it mailed to him.
	* User who lost his password can ask the system to generate a new one and
	  mail it to him.
	* Email is now a separate field to preserve user privacy.
	* Enforces (politely) that there are no duplicate emails in the database
	* Database abstraction layer with very nice debugging features (just append
	  true at the end of the call, and you'll see the query, the results, the
	  query plan and number of affected rows.  Also allow future upgrade to
	  postgres.
	* Lots of other things I forgot.
