*****************************
RADIUS authentication support
*****************************

You'll need these RPM packages

libphp5-commons
php5-cli
php5-devel
php5-xml
php5-xmlrpc ---> requires libxmlrpc

run this in a shell
"lynx -source http://go-pear.org | php5"

*************
WARNING:
You must have PHP5 CLI with php5ize installed
*************
Make sure your include_path refers to your PEAR install
ie. /usr/share/pear

Now you'll need a few packages, you can let PEAR install them
automatically, make sure you have Console_Opt, Archive_Tar et XML_RPC
before you do this.

Run those scripts
/usr/share/pear/scripts/pear.sh install Auth
/usr/share/pear/scripts/pear.sh install radius   ( PECL module compilation)
/usr/share/pear/scripts/pear.sh install Auth_RADIUS


Enjoy!
